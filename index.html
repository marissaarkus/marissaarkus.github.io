	<h2> Because I am just like Moolissa</h2>
	<p> A controversial documentary filmmaker named Randy (Paul F. Tompkins) starts filming his new documentary outside the restaurant, and ties a cow, named "Moolissa" (a male cow with a blonde wig on it) outside the restaurant. Bob sees this, and Randy explains his challenge for him: he can kill Moolissa and make her into a burger, or let her live; he is to make his decision when a timer placed outside the restaurant, called the "Cow-ntdown", stops. Bob becomes embarrassed about the whole situation, as well as Louise frequently calling him a murderer. Despite this, as a result of the publicity, the restaurant starts attracting more customers.</p>
